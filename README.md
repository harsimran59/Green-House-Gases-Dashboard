### Exploring Environmental Impact: Interactive Scatterplot Generator for Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The project aims to provide a comprehensive and visually intuitive understanding of greenhouse gas emissions through an interactive scatterplot generator. As the global community grapples with climate change, it becomes increasingly important to analyze and interpret data related to emissions from various sources. Our tool offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to explore and compare emissions across different variables, shedding light on the intricate relationships within this critical environmental context.

### Key features: 

- **Variable Selection:** Users can choose from a range of variables such as industrial activity, transportation, energy production, and more, to observe their respective contributions to greenhouse gas emissions.

- **Time Series Analysis:** The scatterplot generator enables users to track changes over time, offering insights into the evolving patterns of emissions and identifying potential trends or areas of concern.

- **Customizable Metrics:** Users can customize the metrics displayed on the scatterplot, allowing for a tailored analysis based on specific greenhouse gases, emission units, or other relevant parameters.
